# Tally

Tally is (going to be) a Chrome extension for my wife. It's a general data entry automater.

### Resources

#### Libraries

- [wxt framework](https://wxt.dev/)
- [google-spreadsheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet)

#### Documentation

- [google oauth](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/how-to/integrate/oauth)

#### Miscellaneous

- [Testing Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aSm4nwINqe_GxEDEjNlBy21mJzHi9Ort5iZJtpGBCyQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Ideas

- Allow user to click "Configure"
  - Configure lets them click an element that will have a reference item, such as a name in a row.
  - Then they click the corresponding form field to fill in.
  - Both then set the selectors that the application will use for determining how to fill in the form (so it's dynamic)
